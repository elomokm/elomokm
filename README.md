- 👋 Hi, I’m @elomokm, a 20-year-old AI & Big Data MSc student from Benin, currently studying in France and working as a software engineer apprentice at QUOBLY.
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a top Machine Learning Engineer and an expert in data science, focusing on projects that leverage AI to solve real-world problems. I’m also passionate about tech startups and aspire to build a tech ecosystem in West Africa, particularly in Benin.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced machine learning algorithms, data analysis, and Vue.js to improve my project management and development skills.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on innovative tech projects, especially those involving AI, Big Data, and IoT, and I'm open to discussions with the African tech community and anyone aiming to make an impact in these fields.
